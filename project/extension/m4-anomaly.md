# Extension: M4 Anomaly

In assessing the scaled overlay graphs an argument could be constructed that these results could be skewed internally due to the nature of aftershocks. After a large seismic event a large volume if aftershocks could effect the volume results for a localized period, whose aggregate might effect the high volatility seen in the scaled overlay graphs. To test this argument a graph of the most active years for M4.0-9 event occurrences was created using the “marker” calendar schedule. Peak volumes were identified and an association made to concurrent strong magnitude event (see opposite page).

Discussion

An internal aftershocks skew argument does not hold up under closer inspection as the peak “marker” periods in the M4.0-9 scaled overlay graph were Mk5, Mk6, Mk7, & Mk15. The graph for the proximal large magnitude events does indicate that greater volumes of events occurred during those time “markers”, the volume does not support the volatility seen in the scaled overlay. Mk1 & Mk2 show large volume of localized activity but these volumes do not translate to volatility in the associated M4.0-9 scaled overlay. Within the total time span range of the graph there were a total of 144 large magnitude events with a minimum magnitude to M7.0. Out of these 144 events less than 10% could be seen to be possibly related to a sudden increase in M4.0-9 activity. This suggests that localized aftershocks do not skew the aggregate results seen the overlay graphs.
