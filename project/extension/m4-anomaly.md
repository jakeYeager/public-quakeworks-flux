# Extension: M4 Anomaly

Reviewing the scaled graphs an argument could be made that the results could be skewed internally due to aftershocks. After a large seismic event the increase in aftershocks could effect the volume total for a short-term period, the aggregate of which might have influence on the high volatility seen in the scaled graphs. To test this, a graph of the most active years for M4.0-9 events was created using the [marker schedule](../setup/the-marker.md). Activity peaks were identified and an association attempted to a concurrent strong magnitude event.

## Discussion: M4 Anomaly

Skewing due to short-term aftershocks does not appear to happen as the peak marker periods in the [M4 scaled overlay graph](../tests/scaled-marker-graphs.md#m4-sample-population) were Mk5, Mk6, Mk7, & Mk15. The following [graph](#proximal-large-magnitude-events-graph) for the "Proximal Large Magnitude Events" does indicate that greater spikes in activity occurred during the years of 2003-10, but the volume **per marker** does not support the volatility seen in the [M4 scaled overlay graph](../tests/scaled-marker-graphs.md#m4-sample-population). In the following [graph](#proximal-large-magnitude-events-graph), the periods for Mk1 & Mk2 show large spikes of localized activity, but these volumes do not translate to volatility in the associated [M4 scaled overlay graph](../tests/scaled-marker-graphs.md#m4-sample-population). Within the total year range of 2003-10 there were a total of 144 large magnitude events with a minimum magnitude to M7.0. Out of these 144 events less than 10% could be seen to be possibly related to a sudden increase in M4.0-9 activity. Given this, it is not likely that short-term aftershocks have skewed the aggregate results.
