# Extension: By Depth
By drilling down into the sample populations and compare the aspect of the depth of an earthquake occurrence to it's marker timing it is possible to see another clustering in the data.

## M6 by Depth
If the depth of an event from the M6 sample population is plotted by marker and depth (*see following chart*) a naturally occurring pause in events can be seen between the depths of ~250km and ~400km.[^first] Splitting this population at 300km and graphing the totaled results by marker shows few surprises except for the sharp drop in the deep events (>300km) at Mrk8, an approximate 60% decrease from volume at Mrk7.

## M7 by Depth
By splitting the M7 sample at 300km stronger clustering begins to show. The shallower event rate remains fairly stable with a pronounced drop in activity at Mrk9. The deep event rate jumps between Mrk7 and Mrk11. The average more than doubles to 8.6 deep events per marker (from 3.7/mrk) for a short, defined period that overlaps the Mrk9 drop in shallow M7.

## M8 by Depth
Extending this to the M8 sample there is a decrease in shallow activity between Mrk7 and Mrk11 (no shallow events during Mrk8!), similar to the previous examples, but  **100%** of deep M8 events happen during this period (all four :smile:).

From the following three examples it is possible to see during the period before the northern hemisphere "Summer" solstice (and aphelion) there is a decrease in shallow event activity with a corresponding increase in deep event volatility.
