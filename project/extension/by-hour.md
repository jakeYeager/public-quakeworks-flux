# Extension: By Hour

Reviewing the total population of earthquake events by hour the primary feature of the trend line is a large dip in activity at `Hr06 = 16,497` and a steady increase in activity at it's maximum 12 hour-categories later at `Hr17 = 18,140`. Remembering that this population represents the totality of global event output, the difference between the high and the low is `1,733` events. This is an approx 10% swing from low to high about the average of `17,338` events by hour.

## Alignment At Maximum Hour

Remembering that earthquake timestamps are recorded in the [Coordinated Universal Time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html), if the position of the Sun in relationship to the Earth's surface is recreated at the time of maximum activity (17:00 hours UTC) the respective position of the land masses to the Sun would remain consistent throughout the year (as no allowance is given to "daylights savings" in UTC). The following image shows an approximate representation of this alignment. As this alignment is maintained daily, regardless of time of year, a regional population sample of earthquakes from a seismically active area is included. The conditional coloring indicates that at the time of global peak activity the regional area also reflects this trend (green arrow). The low point of activity for this region is 07:00 UTC, which is also is close to the global low.

## Alignment At Minimum Hour

If the same testing method was made on a region 12 hours later it can be seen that the activity peak and valley is **reversed** for time in UTC _but consistent respective to Sun-Earth alignment_.

When the Sun is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sampled area, in both examples, there is a corresponding increase in aggregate activity. Approximately 12 hours later, in both examples, there is a decrease aggregate activity.
