# Background

Let's start with the specific claims so we can point at them as we go:

## The Claims

What **IS** being claimed:

1) There is an **apparent phenomenon** in naturally occurring seismic event (earthquakes) populations as seen by **significantly divergent** statistical comparisons to equivalent randomly generated data populations.
2) This divergence is specific to the events recorded **timestamp** of occurrence.
3) This phenomenon would indicate that earthquake occurrence is **not** randomly distributed through time.
4) This phenomenon appears to be **unrecognized** by the scientific community or at least not publicly described or clearly stated.

What is **NOT** being claimed:

1) That knowledge of this phenomenon can be used to predict earthquakes (not going to even touch this).
2) That this phenomenon is directly generating or creating earthquakes (results suggest a period of suppression as well as an associated period of expression).

## The Problem

### False Positive

I'm a web developer in northern California. And before you click away thinking _"of course a web developer from northern California is going to start his site talking about himself"_, here's why relevant:

- A skill my job requires is that I can populate, store, retrieve and compute large quantities of data efficiently and accurately.
- Another required skill is the ability to test if a set of logic conditions will fail, where it fails, and then how to fix it.

And thusly...

- I have tried to break this.
- **AND** I cannot break it.
- **AND** I cannot find a (reasonable and clearly stated) description of this phenomenon online.

...and finally...

- I need help breaking it (validating it's non-existence).
- **OR** Someone else outside my closed-loop not able to cannot break it (validating it's existence).
- **OR** Finding a resource or body of work that reasonably describes this (validating/invalidating it's existence).

I've reworked the data/logic enough that I'm confident I do not have a(n obvious) logic bug or tainted data source. **It still could be a false positive**. This was initially a weekend tum-tee-tum, which has morphed into a passion project, and is now an abject obsession. But currently it's just me, and am highly sensitive to the fact that makes me the closed-loop process. *"It works fine on my computer"* is indeed an answer, but not a solution (and will get you fired in IT-landia).


## The Site

What would any self-respecting web developer do next?

Write the documentation! Maybe sprinkle some emoji around :100: As this site is part documentation, part blog, part [*Quod Erat Demonstrandum*](https://www.mathopenref.com/qed.html), and part cry for help this site (and associated data repo) will be published on Github. There it can be merrily versioned, eyeballed, timestamped, questioned and reused for other passion projects. I'm using [the good stuff](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/) so sharpen your [markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/) pencil.
