# The Marker

A categorical time framework was created to compare randomly generated events to real seismic event timestamps. The common Gregorian calendar method divides the year into a twelve “month” categorical framework of segmented time. This division of twelve was not the only framework used in this analysis, as a division of sixteen year allotments provided better analytical qualities. Twelve divisions of 365.24 days make 30.43 day allotments, while sixteen divisions of 365.24 makes 22.82 day allotments requiring fewer divisions with odd day counts. Fourteen division provides the best 365.24 day allotment with 26.08 day allotments. Comparing divisional groups of fourteen (i.e. quarters) could not be categorically done. Sixteen has full internal comparison of divisional groups (i.e. halves, quarters, eights and sixteenths). Finally, by using more categories (sixteen instead of twelve), a more fine-grained insight would be provided for showing random number selection behavior of the algorithms, as well as for the seismic event data.

| Year Division | Day Allotment | Comment                                        |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **12**        | 30.43         | poor allotment; good divisional comparison     |
| **14**        | 26.08         | best allotment; poor divisional comparison     |
| **16**        | 22.82         | good allotment; best divisional comparison     |

A unique categorical time framework was made based on sixteen division calendar, each division called **marker**. Days were allotted into a marker schedule which was then used to match and categorize event timestamps.
