# The Marker
“The Marker” method employs a sixteen year division which not only give a more consistent day segmentation of the year, but also provide a more flexible framework for internal comparison. 

## Day Segmentation
If one year was broken into 16 segments of 23-day increments, this would create a 368 day-entity framework. To correct the 3 day overage, one segment period was reduced to an allotted 22 days and another one 21 days. The 21-day block was designated to contain "Leap Day", extending that block to 22 days once every four years. Having only two segment periods having odd day-counts improves upon the need for equal opportunity as desired for this investigation.

## Internal Comparative Framework
The 12 year-sections of months in the Gregorian calendar cannot provide internal comparison past quarters (three-month sections). By employing 16 divisions, full internal comparison is available  from the whole to the individual parts: whole, halves, quarters, eighths and sixteenths.

By keying the schedule of marker periods to align with the approximate start of, or to contain the occurrences of annual astronomical geometries (solstice/equinox and aphelion/perihelion), the calendar could also embed another layer of timing information.
