# Testing The Test

The framework for comparison should be evaluated to ensure equal-opportunity for both the real and random data. From the earthquake population we will use the timestamp, then generate random data to match. There are many tools available to generate random and pseudo-random data, and even random dates[^first]!

These generators were **not** used because they are based on the Unix epoch[^second] timestamp format. Dates are generated by the number of seconds that have occurred from the center point of Jan 1, 1970. A test based on Unix epoch timestamps would test for opportunities _in seconds_. Therefore any test will flattened to that base measure, making random-date generators a brittle testing method. The difference in seconds should be an aspect to test, but ideally there should be a variety of approaches.
