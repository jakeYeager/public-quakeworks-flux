# Testing The Test

The framework for comparison should be evaluated to ensure equal-opportunity for both the real and random. From the earthquake population we will use the timestamp, then generate random data to match. There are many tools available to generate random and pseudo-random data, and even random dates: [random dates!](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#fakerproviderdatetime).

Caution is advised because many of these date/time generators are based on the [Unix epoch timestamp](https://www.epochconverter.com/) format. Dates are generated by the number of seconds that have occurred from the center point of Jan 1, 1970. The date of Jan 1, 1970 is the big zero of the that number line, and all timestamps before zero as negative seconds, and all time after are positive seconds. Running a test based on Unix epoch timestamps would _only_ test for opportunities between two dates _in seconds_. Therefore any test will flattened to that base measure, making random-date generators a brittle method. The difference in seconds should be an aspect to test, ideally there should be a variety of approaches.
