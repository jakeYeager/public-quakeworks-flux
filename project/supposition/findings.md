# Findings

Through the various analytical profiles detailed in this report it is more likely that the distribution of seismic events through time is not random. The geometric overlay analysis illustrates that there are trend characteristics that are shared with purely random sets but also exhibit consistencies which could only be provided by a controlling principal or law. The scaled overly analysis illustrates that a one-to-one volume comparison of possible categorical time values is also not proximal. The standard deviation analysis further illustrates that increasingly larger compared volumes become ever more divergent to a randomized set. The auxiliary analysis of possible internal skew, due to the nature of aftershocks, demonstrates that even the highest level of localized activity associated with a large magnitude event was insufficient to meaningfully skew the results. The conclusion of this report is that while it may be appropriate to state that the linear sequence of seismic event occurrence displays behavior similar to random number sets, it is statistically highly improbable that the categorical distribution of events through time is random, and therefore their distribution must have organization.
