# Random Data Generation

::: tip Data Repository
Extended documentation as well as CSV data files can be found in the associated [data repo](https://github.com/jakeYeager/qw-data-flux).
:::

Random number sets were generated using commonly available random number generators. Several different generators were used to provide a comparison between the random sets, as well as a more robust test against the seismic events.

### Characteristics

- **Five sets** were generated by each generator.
- Each set containing **six batches** that were matched in volume to respective magnitude-segmented sample populations.
- Each **single entity** had an associated randomly generated number to represent _MONTH_, [_Marker_](../setup/the-marker.md), and _HOUR_.
- Each batch of random numbers was generated as independently as possible, and not by subdividing a singular pool of numbers.
