::: tip SYNOPSIS
A constrained maximum data population of seismic events was downloaded from the FDSN web service via the USGS API. The population was then segmented by magnitude. 

Random numbers were generated to match entities within the seismic event population. 

A refined calendaring framework based on sixteen year segments was created. Seismic events were matched to this new "marker" calendar schedule.
