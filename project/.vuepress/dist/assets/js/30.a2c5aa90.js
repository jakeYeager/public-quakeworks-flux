If commonality could be shown in the graphical patterns, it could indicate there was a governing principal effecting the output, and therefore could not be random. The output from each batch was first plotted on a simple line graph. Each line was then extracted from the graph scale, then given the same geometrical height (i.e. the line's maximum and minimum were aligned). The adjusted lines were then overlaid for direct visual comparison. If the result's output is sufficiently random, the resulting graphics should show a chaotic variation of patterning with few congruences.")])])},[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=n.exports}}]);
