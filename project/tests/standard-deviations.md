# Narrative: Standard Deviations

To further illustrate the trend disparity and also include the “blue dye” data, a standard deviation analysis was created. The “blue dye” had previously been shown to behave randomly in its trends within the geometric overlay analysis, so could provide useful insight in comparing seismic data to an extreme random entity volume. Even though the “blue dye” result values were higher than other sets, the deviation of those values could show a comparative trait. The standard deviation for every batch was tabled and plotted categorically.


The graph clearly shows that within the parameters of this report’s analysis technique, comparing a volume of seismic data to a volume of random data, an increase approaching x10 the volume is required of random data entities in order to create an approximate comparison. Within these results an example can be seen by comparing “rSet5 Batch1” (results from 500,000 entities) with a variance of 230.258 has a slightly greater variance than the seismic data “EQKS Batch2” (results from 67,112 entities) with the value of 208.835 .
