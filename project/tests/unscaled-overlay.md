# Narrative: Unscaled Overlay

### Sparklines

The purpose of this analysis was to visually show any possible common trend or activity behavior existent in all set batches. If commonality could be shown in the graphical patterns, it would suggest a governing principal effecting the results, and therefore not random. To accomplish this the results for each batch was first plotted on a line graph. Each plotted line was then extracted from the graph scale and each graphic given the same dimensional height. The adjusted batch line patterns of each set were then overlaid for direct visual comparison. A complete exhibit of this process for each set is detailed in the Data Addendum. The compiled graphics can be seen in Geometric Overlay Comparisons (see opposite page).

The resulting graphics show a chaotic variation of patterning with few congruences. The defining feature in the Seismic Record Set (bottom graphic) is a deep trough in the middle of the graphic, a trough shared by all the trend lines in that set. There are similar features apparent in the random data graphics, but they do not share the depth and duration seen in the Seismic Record Set.
