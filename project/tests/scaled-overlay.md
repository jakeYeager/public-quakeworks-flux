# Narrative: Scaled Overlay

To complement the geometric overlay analysis, a simple scaled overlay analysis was constructed by graphing matching batch results together on the same scale. 

Note: In this analysis, the “blue dye” batches are not included in the M4.0-9 and M5.0-9 scaled overlay graphs. The trend patterns can be seen as the expected random behavior within the non-scaled test (the geometric overlay analysis), but as the skewed entity volume is so disproportionate to actual data quantities, the values as graphed points would be meaningless and impractical to include. The M6.0-9 scaled overlay graph does include all batches.

The graphs for batches 1, 2 & 3 have been included as they best demonstrate the disparate trend behavior. High variation is apparent between the seismic record batch and the randomly generated batches. The random batches do stray away from the average trend line but remain within a limited proximal range. The M5.0-9 graph has volatility far greater then was is possible in randomly generated data, even with almost 5 times fewer entities than the M4.0-9 batches.
